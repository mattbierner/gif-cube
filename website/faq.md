# FAQ

## What are the cubes made of?

The cubes are made of colored sandstone. They are hard yet brittle, and should not be exposed to water.

## Are the cubes solid?

The cubes are hollow to reduce weight and manufacturing costs. A small hole on the bottom of the cube gives access to its interior. This hole is shown as a solid gray square on the bottom of the cube in the preview.

Being hollow does have other advantages. For example, you can put lights inside of the cubes to turn them into colorful, glowing, gif nightlights. 

## What about image quality?

The cubes can capture a wide range of colors at a fairly high resolution, but there a limitations, especially given that many gifs are low resolution and have poor color accuracy. For best results, upload the highest quality, highest resolution version of your gif.

The colors on the cubes may not exactly match what you see on the screen while ordering. Additionally, very fine details—such as those under 1/4 of a millimeter or so—may be lost during the manufacturing process.
